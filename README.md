# DesktopClean

This project was created as a test for my Python skills. This app's purpose is to declutter the desktop workspace into specific folders depending on the file type. 

Throughout this project, I had to manually create a dictionary for the file types I may encounter. As there is no (as far as I have searched) complete library on all existing file types, this program will only work on the file types that have been placed inside the dictionary. 

Thank you for checking out this project. This was my first Python project that was not for data analysis and throughout this project, I have learned a lot.
